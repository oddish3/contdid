This directory contains files necessary to estimate the models in the
following paper:

     Bleakley, Hoyt. 2010. "Malaria Eradication in the Americas: A
     Retrospective Analysis of Childhood Exposure," American Economic
     Journal: Applied.

The files needed to estimate models in Section 3 ("Pre/Post
Comparisons") are found in the directory "longdiff".  Files for each
country are grouped by subdirectory.  The longdiff*dta files are stata
(v11) data files, and the longdiff*.do are stata programs that
estimate the models.  The unit of observation for these data are state
of birth.  The demographic outcome variables are constructed as
changes from the early (unexposed) to late (exposed) cohorts.  

The files needed to estimate models in Section 4 ("Panel Estimates")
are found in the directory "panel".  Files for each country are
denoted in the filename with two-letter country abbreviations.  The
panel*dta files are stata (v11) data files, and the panel_results.do
is a stata program that estimates the models.

The unit of observation for these data are state of birth times year
of birth times census year.  (The data are therefore a 3-dimensional
panel.)  The demographic outcome variables are averages within these
cells.

Note that these are all aggregated datasets.  The original source data
and the details of aggregation are described in Section 3 and in the
Appendix.  

Log files for the stata estimation programs are provided in each
directory for convenience.
